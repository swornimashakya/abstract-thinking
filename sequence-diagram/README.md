# Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are simple visual representations that show how different parts (actors, systems, or objects) interact with each other in a specific order to complete a process. They use vertical lines for each participant and arrows to show the messages or actions passed between them over time.

## In Simple Terms
- **Who talks to whom, and in what order?**
- Each participant is a vertical line.
- Arrows show the flow of messages or actions.
- The diagram reads from top to bottom, showing the sequence of steps.

## Use Cases
- **Explaining how a system works step-by-step** (e.g., login process, payment flow)
- **Documenting communication between services or components**
- **Clarifying requirements for developers and stakeholders**
- **Spotting potential issues in process flows**

## Files in this folder
- **issuer-acquirer-flow.puml**: PlantUML diagram showing the flow between a customer, merchant, acquirer, card network, and issuer bank during a card transaction process.

**How to use:**
- Open `.puml` files with a PlantUML viewer or extension to visualize the sequence diagram.
