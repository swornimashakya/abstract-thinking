# Abstract Thinking

Abstract thinking is the ability to understand ideas that aren’t tied to physical objects or specific situations. It helps you spot patterns, make connections, and think about systems and processes. This skill is important for solving problems, creating new ideas, and understanding complex topics in technology, science, and everyday life.
