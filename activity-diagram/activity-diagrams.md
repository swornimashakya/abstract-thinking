# Activity Diagrams

## What are Activity Diagrams?

Activity diagrams are visual representations of workflows and processes. They show the flow of control from one activity to another, making it easy to understand the sequence of actions and decision points in a system or process.

## Key Components

| Component | Shape | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Action | Rounded Rectangle | A specific task or step. |
| Decision | Diamond | Choosing a path based on a condition. |
| Fork | Thick Line/Bar | Splitting one flow into multiple parallel flows. |
| Swimlane | Column/Row | Assigning actions to specific actors or departments. |

## Use Cases

1. **Business Process Modeling**: Visualize workflows like order processing, customer onboarding, or approval processes
2. **Software Development**: Map out user interactions, system behaviors, and algorithm logic
3. **Project Planning**: Outline project phases and task dependencies
4. **Troubleshooting**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in existing processes
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear visual documentation for complex procedures

## Benefits

- **Clarity**: Makes complex processes easy to understand at a glance
- **Communication**: Bridges gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Analysis**: Helps identify redundancies and optimization opportunities
- **Standardization**: Ensures everyone follows the same process
